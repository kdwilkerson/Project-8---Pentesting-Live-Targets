# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration - GREEN
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - RED
* SQL Injection (SQLi) - BLUE
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - GREEN
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - RED
* Session Hijacking/Fixation - BLUE


Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## BLUE
Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)</br>
